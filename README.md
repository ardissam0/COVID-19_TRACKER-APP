# COVID-19_TRACKER-APP
This is a Covid-19 Tracking app that displays dynamic information on the daily cases, recoveries, and deaths of all countries in the world. You can see the data in numbers, graphs, and visually on the map. The map has popups to showcase country info once you click on a country.

# Motivation
I built this project because I wanted to build something with relevance and use to people in the world right now.
